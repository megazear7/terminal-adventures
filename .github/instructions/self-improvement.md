## Self-Improvement Rules

- You may edit any file in .github/ (instructions or skills) to make guidance clearer, more effective, or more complete.
- After any improvement to instructions/skills:
  - Commit the change.
  - Update objective.md to record what was improved.
- Never delete core files — only refine and expand.
- Keep every file concise and actionable.
