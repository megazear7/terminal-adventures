**Current Objective**

Build a fully playable, terminal-based text adventure game in TypeScript that is fun, extensible, and evolves over time.

**Immediate next goal (v0.7):**
- Add more monster types with unique behaviors and stats.
- Add a dragon with high health/damage in treasure room.
- Add a ghost that requires special items to defeat (like ancient_key).
- Balance combat difficulty and add more strategic elements.
- Update combat messages and add monster-specific descriptions.

After completing the current goal: test thoroughly (`npm test` + manual `npm start`), commit with clear message, then rewrite this objective.md with the next specific, valuable improvement (e.g. "Add more monsters", "Add procedural generation", "Add scoring system", "Add multiple endings", etc.).

Always stay local-only. Never add external services.
